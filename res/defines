# bakka: Welcome to the defines file! 
# bakka: defines is the core configurations file used by Autobuild3 to read building definitions (obviously) such as package name, version, category/section, dependencies, descriptions, etc. 
# bakka: defines is meant to be a powerful configuration file, and hence supports an extensive amount of control variables.
